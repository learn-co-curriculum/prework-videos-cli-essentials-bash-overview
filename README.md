# BASH Overview

## Learning Goals

+ Identify differences between command-line interface, terminal emulator, and shell
+ View file contents with `cat` and `open`
+ Identify our "home directory"
+ Define "Command Line Interface"
+ Identify the current working directory" with `pwd` ("print working directory")
+ Navigate up one directory in the file system
+ Change directories using `cd`
+ List directory files in the shell with `ls`
+ Move or rename files and directories with `mv`
+ Create empty files with `touch`
+ Make new directories with `mkdir`
+ Remove files with `rm`
+ Describe the purpose of CLIs

## Outline
Cover basic directory structure, history of the terminal, and basic BASH commands (cd, ls, touch, mkdir)

**NOTE** No starter code require, simply open a Learn IDE in Browser Window to identify the terminal. 

+ Discuss history of computers
  + "Way back when in the 1980s, using a Terminal was the only way to interact with computers."
  + Show Finder for Mac, how it's a representation of files that are on the computer. Graphical User Interface, or GUI
  + Link to Pirates of Silicon Valley Clip that demonstrates this
+ Explain why software developers use terminal interface
  + Faster to use
  + Easier to create tools without a GUI
+ Demonstrate some basic BASH commands
  + pwd - what directory am I in?
  + ls (or ls .)- what's in this directory? . meaning current directory
  + cd .. - move up one directory
  + Discuss relative vs absolute paths
  + Create a new file with `touch`
    + this is something you can only really do from the Terminal
  + Create a new directory and move the file into that directory
  + Remove the file and the directory
